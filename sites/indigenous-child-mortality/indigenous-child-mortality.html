      <h1>Infant Mortality and SIDS</h1>
      <h3>Aberdeen Indian Health Service Area</h3>
	  <h4>Clara J. Devota</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p> Infant mortality and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, or SIDS, has plagued Native American communities ever since systematic
		 oppression by Western colonialism began. The Aberdeen Indian Health Service provides health care and public health monitoring 
		 for nineteen tribal communities across Iowa, Nebraska, and North and South Dakota, a region which continues to have some of the 
		 most alarming rates of infant loss within the United States. This issue lies not in death of neonates, which are categorized as 
		 infants age zero to one month, but in death during the post-neonatal period of one month to one year of age. SIDS is the sudden 
		 and unexpected death of a seemingly healthy baby, and research shows a rate of 10.7 deaths per 1,000 live births amongst White 
		 Americans compared to 27.6 deaths per 1,000 live births for communities within the Aberdeen region. The alarmingly high rate of 
		 SIDS is matched by the high rate of post-neonatal infant mortality, which is characterized as infant death with known circumstantial 
		 causes. Throughout the Aberdeen area, the statistic is 15.8 deaths per 1,000 live births which is nearly five times the mortality rate 
		 for White Americans. SIDS and Infant Mortality present a major public health issue for communities around the globe; however, these problems 
		 amongst the Aberdeen Native American communities add a layer of sorrow to an already existing barrage of poverty, chronic illness, and cultural 
		 perpetuation. This region is home to communities with the highest poverty rates within the United States and the world. Most notably the Ogala Souix 
		 Reservation at Pine Ridge consistently remains the poorest county within the U.S., and the living conditions of its residents serve
		 to agitate the already elevated rates of SIDS and Infant Mortality among Native Americans. Despite these tragedies, the Indigenous 
		 communities of the Aberdeen area, in conjunction with the Indian Health Service, have taken initiative to remedy the high mortality amongst 
		 infants in the hope of creating a better standard of living throught the reduction of SIDS and Infant Mortality rates
		 and preserving Native American cultures through their youth.</p>
