      <h1>Infant Mortality and SIDS</h1>
      <h3>Aberdeen Indian Health Service Area</h3>
	  <h4>Clara J. Devota</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p> Infant mortality and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, or SIDS, has plagued Native American communities ever since systematic oppression by Western colonialism began. The Aberdeen Indian Health Service provides health care and public health monitoring for nineteen tribal communities across Iowa, Nebraska, and North and South Dakota, a region which continues to have some of the most alarming rates of infant loss within the United States. The broad spectrum of Infant Mortality is categorized into three subsections: Neonatal Infant Mortality (0-28 days), Post-Neonatal Infant Mortality (28-365 days), and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. The SIDS epidemic lies not in death of neonates, but in death during the post-neonatal period of one month to one year of age. SIDS is the sudden and unexpected death of a seemingly healthy baby. The list below presents Infant mortality rates as the number of deaths per 1,000 live births:

	SIDS is the sudden and unexpected death of a seemingly healthy baby and Neonatal and Post-Neonatal Mortality are characterized as deaths with known causes and/or circumstances. The alarmingly high rate of SIDS, which is nearly double the average for all U.S. races, is matched by the high rate of post-neonatal infant mortality. However, neonatal mortality amongst the Aberdeen tribal communities is less disparate at only 17% above the national average. SIDS and Infant Mortality present a major public health issue for communities around the globe; however, these problems amongst the Aberdeen Native American communities add a layer of sorrow to an already existing barrage of poverty, chronic illness, and cultural perpetuation. This region is home to communities with the highest poverty rates within the United States and the world. Most notably the Ogala Souix Reservation at Pine Ridge consistently remains the poorest county within the U.S. and the living conditions of its residents serve to agitate the already elevated rates of SIDS and Infant Mortality among Native Americans. Despite these tragedies, the Indigenous communities of the Aberdeen area, in conjunction with the Indian Health Service, have taken initiative to remedy the high mortality amongst infants in the hope of creating a better standard of living and preserving Native American cultures through their youth.

		 <h3>The Causes</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p> <u>Neonatal Mortality</u>:&#160 Though the Infant Mortality and SIDS epidemic amongst these communities is evidenced primarily in infants within the post-neonate period, neonatal mortality is still much higher than the national average. Though the exact factors leading to neonatal death are still debated, a primary concern has been pinpointed as complications during labor and delivery due to a high birth weight. Native American infants express much higher birth weights than their white counterparts, and this is due in part to the epidemic of diabetes amongst the Aberdeen Indian communities. Mother’s classified as diabetic prior to pregnancy and those who develop gestational diabetes frequently give birth to larger babies which can result in trauma to the child while moving through the birth canal. 
		 <br>
		 <br>
		Following birth, infants of diabetic mothers may have elevated levels of insulin in their blood, but no longer have the high glucose levels which can result in a sharp decrease of blood sugar levels, or hypoglycemia. This hypoglycemia may become so severe that it causes seizures and death. Other cause of neonatal mortality are related to the prenatal period and the health of a mother throughout pregnancy. Drinking alcohol and smoking throughout pregnancy may stunt brain development resulting in infant death. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<p><u>Post-Neonatal Mortality</u>:&#160 Post-neonatal mortality, or death occurring from 28 to 365 days of life, relates to death with known causes such as congenital birth defects and infection. This subset of infant mortality can be described as the “other” category. Due to the broad nature of post-neonatal mortality being a designation given to any death with known circumstantial and biological causes, definitive causes of the 276% higher mortality rate amongst the Aberdeen communities in comparison to the U.S. national average cannot be accurately defined. However, researchers have speculated the reasons behind this high rate as being access to healthcare. An American Indian child born with a defect may lack the proper care to survive with the abnormality, thus the condition becomes fatal. Another failure of healthcare within the Aberdeen region is the lower rate of vaccination amongst residents, often a result of isolated communities lacking access to vaccines. Young children are particularly susceptible to bacterial infections because their adaptive immunities have not yet been built, with the exception of some immunity provided in utero and through breast feeding. Without vaccinations, infants are more likely to fall prey to pneumonia, pertussis/whooping cough, and a host of other bacterial infections. These infections can also be spurred on by the poor living conditions endured by Indian communities of the Great Plains. Contaminated food and water sources, and abysmal sanitary measures provide breeding grounds for deadly bacterial. The Aberdeen Indian Health Service is the primary care provider for Native Americans of this region, but lacking funds and a vast and remote geographic landscape make it difficult for the service to provide vaccinations for its nearly 100,000 constituents. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<p><u>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)</u>:&#160 Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, sometimes referenced as Sudden Unexpected Infant Death, has the highest rate of occurrence of infant mortalities in the Aberdeen Service Area at roughly 18.1 deaths per every 1,000 live births. These unexpected tragedies have circumstantial causes often unknown or indeterminable, thus a high SIDS risk relates more to the socioeconomic demographics of a community than the innate biological risks infants have. Research has shown many factors can lead to sudden deaths among in infants, and it is often the combination of multiple factors leading to a high incidence of SIDS. The list below provides a few possible causes for SIDS:
		</p>
		<p>
		<p class="indent">
		<ul>
  <li>Lacking prenatal support - Prenatal visits for expectant mothers amongst the Aberdeen regions are much lower than the national average, and this presents a multitude of factors which could relate to a high prevalence of SIDS. Prenatal doctor visits not only aid in monitoring the health of fetus and mother, but also serve as great educational sessions for expectant parents. These visits supply information on subjects such as breastfeeding, infant care tips, and emergency preparedness. In individuals lacking this care, SIDS has become more prevalent as knowledge such as how to properly lay a child down to sleep or the skills of how to identify if your child is acting unusual, perhaps signaling illness, are not obtained. The low occurrence of prenatal visits by expecting parents within the Aberdeen area is in part due to the great distance these individuals must travel to receive care, and this is spurred on by the pervasive poverty amongst residents which makes travel nearly impossible.</li>
  <br>
 
  <li>Poor living conditions – As in post-neonatal mortality, poverty and a low socioeconomic environment can lead to SIDS. Living environments lacking sanitary water and food, as well as infestations by rodents are common amongst Aberdeen Indian communities. Diseases such as bacterial meningitis and vector-borne viruses are easily contractible by infants, and in some cases, can also be transferred from the mother to fetus in utero. Bacterial meningitis can kill adults in only eight hours, and the time frame is much shorter in infants, thus it is a probable cause for SIDS.
<br>  
  <br>
Poverty also invokes stressors upon parents which can lead to neglect or parental aggression, resulting in SIDS. Alcoholism is common amongst the constituents of Aberdeen Indian Health Service, and intoxicated parents may forget to check on their infants, resulting in crib deaths via suffocation. Research has shown SIDS cases often occur multiple times in a single family, which could be the result of chronic neglect by parents as a side effect of the stress and emotional taxation induced by severe poverty. Infants demand a large amount of physical and emotional attention which can push caregivers beyond a breaking point when already living in a difficult environment. 
<br>
<br>
</li>
  <li>Smoking - Smoking cigarettes is pervasive amongst Native Americans in the Aberdeen area, and smoking while pregant is not uncommon. Smoking cigarettes while pregnant is tied to an increased risk of SIDS. Research has shown sudden infant death is higher when mothers smoked during pregnancy. The biological reasoning for why this correlation exists is still uncertain, but smoking during gestation is believed to cause****. Smoking the vacinity of or in a home with an infant is also dangerous to the child. If the cigarette smoke remains in the home and proper ventilation is not available, an infant is a risk of suffocating by smoke inhalation, often while sleeping. </li>
