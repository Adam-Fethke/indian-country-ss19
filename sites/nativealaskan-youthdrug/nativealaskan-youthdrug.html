		  <h3>Environment and History</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example--> 
		 <p>The main area in Alaska that this research focuses on is the territory inhabited by the Athabascan people. Eleven distinct linguistic groups and cultures make up the Athabascan people. This area is a large area of Alaska, with a majority of inland territory that connects to Canada on the East side. Athabascan territory begins south of the Brooks Mountain Range and continues down to the Kenai Peninsula (4). However, this does not include the territory that extends down into Canada. In this region, there is a major river, the Tanana River where many tribes are near to for resources and ancestral history. Many years ago, the now Alaskan Natives crossed the Bering Land Bridge from Asia and have inhabited what is now Alaska and Canada for over 30,000 years. White colonists began to settle in this area around the 1900’s for the gold rush, and with this white colonialism began, taking Native land and native resources and taking over a significant amount of traditional culture by spreading technology and trade among other colonial ideals. Today, many Athabascans struggle with finding their roots and culture from before white colonization. </p>
		 
		  <h3>Substance Abuse and Adolescent Brain Development</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example--> 
		 <p>The adolescent brain is a delicate and developing structure. Youth is an extremely vulnerable time for substance abuse because of the increase in negative effects on brain development. Rapid change begins in the brain development of adolescents, and any drug abuse can have a major impact on brain function. One of the major occurrences in adolescence is pruning and myelination of the neurons and neuron sheaths in the brain. Neurons form connections, and myelin sheathes speed up brain functioning. Brains exposed to drugs, such as narcotics, alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco “They look different on brain scans, and they function differently as well” (1). 
		 o     	<u>With the use of alcohol</u>: Decrease in memory, attention, and processing speed. These language deficits consist “even after three weeks of monitored abstinence” (11). 
		 o	    <u>With the use of marijuana</u>: Recently, research has shown “even after four weeks of monitored abstinence, adolescents who regularly smoke marijuana performed poorer on performance tests of learning, cognitive flexibility, visual scanning, error commission, and working memory”(11). 
		 o	    <u>With the use of nicotine</u>: Similarly to alcohol and marijuana, nicotine was found to have negative impact on memory and cognitive functioning “Smoking during adolescence increases the risk of developing psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment in later life. In addition, adolescent smokers suffer from attention deficits, which aggravate with the years of smoking” (14).
		 Substance abuse is dangerous, not only to the community, the culture, and reputation, but most importantly to the <i>individual</i>. These impacts are only a few of the many that alcohol, marijuana, and nicotine cause on the adolescent brain. This does not include narcotics and prescription drugs. Many narcotics, such as the increasingly popular, opioids, are extremely addictive, and even more so for the adolescent brain. This creates a tough cycle that is frequently hard to stop, and can create life-time users. </p>
