      <h1>Art, Representation, and Appropriation</h1>
      <h3>Navajo Nation</h3>
	  <h4>•Chloe E. Wilson•</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p> The Native tribes of the United States remain largely invisible to outsiders. We often are shown or imagine a stereotype, rather than the reality of Native peoples and their lives today. Their art, or rather imitations of their art, however, is seen in popular culture everywhere. It’s manifested on t-shirts, festival costumes, flasks – anything a typical American might be inclined to purchase. The fashion industry especially is guilty of playing off of Hollywood generalizations of Indians adorned in buckskin and feathers. The industry’s influence on American identity leads to this stereotyped image of Indians being the only image that we have, rather than the contemporary Native peoples and styles that are flourishing today. </p>
			<p>The fashion industry is also guilty of cheaply replicating Native art and crafts for economic gain, which reduces true art and design to merely a type of brand for corporations to use. This has been seen in fashion shows in which models were trussed up in headdresses, and it’s been seen in the abundance of knock-offs and imitations that find their way into stores and trading posts. Many consumers don’t pay any mind to where their souvenirs are coming from or who made them, which is the cause of the invisibility that Native peoples are experiencing.</p>
			<p>This webpage will detail the history of the traditional art of Navajo Nation, the art and crafts’ cultural significance, and a study of the misappropriation of such sacred art for the sake of capitalist gain. The Navajo have a rich, extensive culture which is very centered upon maintaining harmony on Earth. This page will also include information about and cases of misappropriation of Navajo art. The tribe’s art is widely popular and while replications are plentiful, these non-Native iterations appropriate the Navajo peoples’ very identities. Tips will also be included in this webpage concerning how to consciously purchase Native arts and crafts. </p>

		<h3>Historical Background</h3>
			<p>The Navajo creation story holds that the original Holy People, the Diyin Diné’é, were the first to generate artistic images using the material of the universe such as clouds, rainbows, and lightning. Since the creation of the universe, all iterations of such artistic images have been replications. The Diné, Earth People, came to their home lands after emerging through three other levels to settle on the fourth.</p>
			<p>The number four itself plays a large role in Navajo culture as an organization principle. It can be seen in various elements of Navajo arts as well as in prayer and architecture. Even more, hózó, a central ideal of Navajo culture, is based upon four: harmony, goodness, wellness, beauty. This organizing principle is also reflected in components of Navajo Nation. In all four directions, there are four sacred mountains which were placed there by the Diyin Diné’é. They taught Earth People the right way to live. Earth People became integral to the order of the universe, so they were taught to do everything to maintain harmony on earth.<p/>

		<h3>Traditional Navajo Art</h3>
		 <p>The Navajo’s organization into four is visually represented in their arts and crafts</p>
		 	<h4>Sand Painting</h4>
		 	<p>The hataali, medicine men, use the four sacred colors in their sand paintings: white shell, turquoise, yellow abalone, and jet black. This particular form of art is one that is deeply tied to ceremony and tradition, and is wiped away after the ceremony is over. Since all original cultural images are always wiped away, any other form would be a mere imitation. However, corporations and artisans alike have produced permanently fixed sand paintings.
		 	<p>In Navajo culture, the images created by hataali are places where the Diyin Diné’é come and go. Different colored minerals and plant pollens are dropped to create anthropomorphic images of the Holy People within specific sacred locales of the past as told by the creation story (Berlo 2014). This is done for a patient who has sought physical or psychological healing. The patient sits within the sand painting and a specific chant is used to reestablish the correct relations between the patient and the forces that they depend on (Navajo People). This form of healing demonstrates the essentialness of the Diné’s connection to all other life. 
		 	<h4>Basket Weaving</h4>
		 	<p>Traditional Navajo baskets, ts’aa’, are used in the ceremonies performed by hataali. Their designs tell the story of harmony and balance between all living creations, making them highly sacred and symbolic objects (Berlo 2014). The baskets’ white, raised center portrays mother Earth, and white breaks from the center to the rim show the path of the Diné to this world. According to Navajo culture, a change in the design could represent a disruption in balance of the forces of life (Berlo 2014).</p>
		 	<h4>Rug Weaving</h4>
		 	<p>Rug weaving in Navajo culture is also linked to the Navajo creation stories. According to them, the spider woman Na’ashjéii wove the world into existence and taught Navajo the art of weaving (Berlo 2014). Traditional rugs incorporate ch’ihónít’l, which connects the weavers energy, spirit, and creativity to the work. This spirit line also connects weavers to their next weaving (Pete).</p>
			<h4>Bead Working</h4>
			<p>Beads made from shell, turquoise, abalone, and jet usede to decorate mountains and embellish objects. Beads are used to dress others or to decorate containers or important objects. Beads of the four sacred colors and in a four-fold symmetry are used to represent again the interconnectedness of life on Earth (Moore 2003).</p>
		<h3>Issues of Replication and Imitation</h3> 
			<p>Since all original Navajo images were created by the Holy People according to tradition, all others after, including those made using traditional methods by Navajo people, are replications(Berlo 2014). Due to the sacred nature of the images, these replications are the only ones that are ethical because they are created either in traditional ceremony, using traditional methods and materials, and often both.</p>
			<p>The replication or imitation of Native art in non-Native contexts is problematic for two main reasons. First, replication by non-Natives essentially rips off the intellectual property of Native artists. Replications are partly the result of globalization as there has been a large increase in cultural trading and learning (Brantmeir 2007). The second issue with replication specifically of Navajo art is that the culture ties so many sacred meanings and purposes to their images that it’s almost dangerous to replicate. In the mid 20th century, ethnographer Maud Oakes was only able to make sketches of the rituals she observed through her sketches and herself being blessed in order to be properly aligned with spiritual forces (Berlo 2014).</p>
			<p>Imitations by non-Natives are rarely culturally accurate. Dominant cultures notoriously have misappropriated more than just art since the colonial period. This misappropriation commodifies, sexualizes, and perverts rich cultural traditions into a Western imaginary isn’t representative of Native cultures.</p>
			<h4>Groups and Regulations</h4>
			<p>Native people own the rights to images that are specific to their family or tribe, which is most important in conflict over representation. In more recent years, there has been much more proprietary regulation regarding the use of Native images in non-Native contexts (Berlo 2014). This is due to the sacredness of Native art and designs.</p>
				<h5>American Indian Arts and Crafts Act</h5>
				<p>The American Indian Arts and Crafts Act maes it illegal to display or sell and product in a way that wrongly suggests that it’s produced by Natives, or the product of a particular Native individual, tribe, or organization (Baker 2012). However, the act isn’t able to protect lucrative products like mass-produced commodities. Furthermore, clothing designs are not copyrightable in the US in general (Baker 2012). This is more problematic for Natives than other due to the nature of the modern day cultural imperialism.</p>
				<h5>Trademark Law</h5>
				<p>Navajo Nation has taken advantage of the Trademark law, with ten registered trademarks of its name (The Fashion Law 2016), making the use of the name Navajo illegal unless within Native context. This is how Navajo Nation won their lawsuit against Urban Outfitters when the corporation introduced multiple products with the Navajo name in their descriptions. Most notable in the lawsuit and most offensive were the Navajo Hipster Panties.</p>
