<h1><strong>Alaskan School System</strong></h1>
      <h3>A Contemporary Look at Alaskan Rural Education</h3>
	  <h4>Nicholas Mells</h4>

	  <br>
  <h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
	  <hr>
<br>
<h5>
<p> Alaskan rural schools have a similar demographic connotation as urban schools have in the lower 48. This meaning that a large sect of the population served in the Alaskan rural school system are inadvertently categorized into a homogenous group, in this case being American Indian or Alaskan Native. This means that policy that is enacted to help the schools are in large part policies that will have a real-time and generational effect on the American Indian and Alaskan Native populations. 
Within knowing this context the aim of my research is to contextualize the historical, geographical, and the political factors that have altered the educational landscape for the American Indian & Alaskan Native population and to highlight the solutions proposed to fix these issues.
</h5>
<br>
<strong> Historical Context of Alaskan Education</strong>
<hr>
<br>
<h5>
<p> The legacy of Native education must first be acknowledged before attempting to have a contemporary understanding of the struggles facing AIAN populations.  Hollie J. Mackey states that “Scholars have identified the historic tension found in federal Indian education laws and policies that have on one hand “purposefully and systematically worked to eradicate Native languages, religions, beliefs, and practices” (Lomawaima & McCarty, 2002, p. 282), while on the other, provide resources and infrastructure to support Indigenous control and cultural self-determination (Lomawaima & McCarty, 2002; Strommer & Osborne, 2014).” (Hollie J. Mackie) 
This duality in policy has not only caused schism in trust but has also caused significant economic impacts in missed opportunities to integrate rural alaskans to the larger economy.

<li>Foreign dependent status</li>
<li>American Indian Boarding Schools (assimilation)</li>
<li>New Deal</li>
<li>No Child left Behind</li> 
<li>Common Core</li>
</ul
<br>
<h5><strong>Problems that are being faced because of this</strong></h5> 
<h5>The myriad of problems is best articulated from the National Education Association, discussing the  complex issues facing community leaders and council; how to culturally and equitably engage in education practices that can benefit community. The National Education Association states:
“The contributions of AIANs [American Indians & Alaskan Natives] in American history and contemporary society have not been adequately recognized in public school curriculums. Too few students know, for instance, that the U.S. Constitution was developed in part upon concepts of democracy gained from the League of the Iroquois. Misconceptions about the "discovery of America by Columbus" do not recognize the pre-existence of sophisticated Indian nations. In addition, the "land bridge" theory of migration perpetuates the myth that all people immigrated to this continent. More needs to be taught about the value and importance of AIAN history and culture.”(NEA Education Issues

<br>
<br>
<h4><strong> Geographical Analysis of Alaskan Rural Schools & Community </strong></h4>
<hr>
<br>

         <h5><p>Known for its peculiar territorial embeddedness; villages and rural areas are nestled within vast expanses of forest, with transportation between state and local governments consisting of maritime or aerial traffic.(reference???) This geographical problem has augmented an already palpable theme many Native communities are challenged with. With factors like isolation, cultural bias, and westernized education goals self-determination and governance begins to play a larger role within native communities in Alaska. (Insert quote here to show what I am talking about) 
When discussing the  labor challenges in terms of Alaskan schools a reoccurring narrative is present within every industry, retention & recruiting.
 “There is an increasing need for quality teachers in Indian schools. Due to rural isolation, low teacher salaries, high poverty, and differences in languages and cultures, it is difficult to recruit and retain quality teachers in Indian schools. Further, the need for special education teachers is growing since representation of AIAN students in special education is at 18 percent, almost double the rest of the student population at 10 percent.”(NEA Education Issues)
To compound this issue Alaska’s teacher turnover whether it be due to retirement, attrition, migration, or transfer must also be factored into this problem as well. With a significantly higher teacher turnover the most under-served students due to this geographical and resources management problem also has the least access to reliable teachers.
 This is because
“In Alaska, teacher turnover is consistently higher in rural schools and districts. At the district level, between 1999 and 2012, it averaged 20% in rural districts, and 10% in Alaska’s five largest districts which are mostly (though not entirely), urban or suburban (Hill & Hirshberg, 2013). At the school level, between 2015-2016 and 2016-2017, rural-remote schools had over 30% teacher turnover; schools in rural hubs had 22%, and in more populated areas the school turnover rate was 14-16% (Stevens & Pierson, 2017).” (UAA Center for Alaska Education Policy Research)
Taking a look at the graph below per student spending rates did increase from 2015. And have been steadily increasing since the begging of the recession(U.S. Census Bureau

<p>
This multi- jurisdictional patchwork of authority and resource management begin to produce a wildly inequitable situation for children growing up the rural school systems here in Alaska.
 Though an even more challenging jurisdiction to navigate is that of the educational authorities governing these populations.
Research provided by sage Education writer Hollie J. Mackey best summarizes this challenge: “Education in Indian Country has become an increasingly contested space as policymakers at the federal, state, and tribal levels negotiate priorities and goals intended to improve academic achievement and promote cultural awareness in schools serving American Indian and Alaska Native students.”(Essa)
The complexity of this issue is in providing AIAN students the cultural and educational attainment that can lead to a more just education that aligns with western standards but also highlights the cultural significane of their own history.

<h4><strong>What's Happening in the wake of Common Core</strong></h4>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<h4><strong> Will Self Determination Be Upheld in this New Era?</strong></h4>
<h5><p>Within the confines of Alaska, this problem has begun to gain some traction within media and the state government. 
With inequitable treatment and low test scores the Governor Bill Walker & current Commissioner of Education Michael Johnson have commissioned a task force named Alaska’s
Education Challenge tasked to target the states low achieving school systems and to establish better programs and initiatives to educate students. 
<br>
 As the councils convened, a specific committee was established to target tribal communities in assessing the needs and policies that would best suit community.
 The Tribal  & Community Ownership subcommittee has set out its goals as:</h5>
<ol>
<li> Tribal/Education Compacting: Allowing tribes and native organizations the option to enter into self-governance compacts with the State of Alaska to gain more autonomy in the
management and delivery of their education system.</li>
<li>Values Allow and encourage regional areas to embed values in the education system.</li>
<li>Centering values around the place.</li>
<li>Partnerships – Strengthening relationships, expanding outreach, balancing power, with
various entities”</li> (Alaskas Education Challenge Tribal & Community Ownership Minutes)
</ol>
<br>
<p>		With this task force comes the opportunity to bury the paradox of self-determination juxtaposed with dependency on Western education systems imposed from colonialism. 
Through the funding of their own dollars, community engagement, and tribal compacting and partnerships an equitable alternative to the failing school system sanctioned by the government might be either reformed or dismantled all together pending a better alternative. 
Alaskan Natives, and most if not all indigenous communities, have been subjected to the brutalities of being forced to assimilate in a system that historically diminishes indigeneity and sovereignty. 
Decolonizing the mind comes from learning, not from a western educational perspective, but by the alternative models that were punished and banned for being alternatives to Western thought.
 To secure a spot for future generations of Native children the education system must be beneficial not only to them but must heal their community as well. 
 Leanne Simpson the author of “As We Have Always Done: Indigenous Freedom Through Radical Resistance” thoughts on the essence of the resurgence of indigenous education relies on her nishnaabewin to understand a decolonized idea of education.</p>
