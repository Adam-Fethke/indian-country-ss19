         <h3>Introduction to the Issue</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>The community of Grassy Narrows is a prime example of environmental injustice.  Like many other native communities, Grassy Narrows, located in Northwestern Ontario, has suffered
		 from colonialist ideals and has lost several cultural aspects as a result.  The following sections will highlight the environmental hardships that this Anishinaabe community has had to deal with in the past, 
		 as well as in the present and will detail the effects that these issues have had on the community and on their culture.  At the bottom, you'll notice that I included a section dedicated
		 to activism.  This is where I'll talk about what Grassy Narrows is doing as a community to resist environmental injustice as well as how they are collaborating with non-natives to make
		 their voices heard by those in power.  </p>

		 <h3>River Pollution</h3>

			</figure>
		 <p>Before discussing the effects that river pollution has had on Grassy Narrows, it is first important to mention how the river became polluted in the first place.  This small community of about 1490 people lies 
		 along the English-Wabigoon river system.  This river had historically provided them with a majority of their sustenance, that being fish, but as the river became polluted, the population of fish became poisonous.  
		 "Between 1962 and 1970, Dryden Chemicals Limited, a pulp and paper mill located about eighty miles upstream from Grassy Narrows, dumped over 20,000 pounds of mercury into the river system as effluent from 
		 its chlor-alkali plant"
