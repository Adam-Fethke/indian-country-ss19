      <h1>Responding to Cultural Appropriation</h1>
      <h3>Navajo Nation</h3>
	  <h4>Alex Walschots</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>Throughout the U.S., nobody is stranger to the countless forms of cultural appropriation that is still circling with society today. We see it in our halloween costumes, our sports teams, and even television shows/movies. With all of the appropriation that surrounds our daily life, many instances seem to pass right under our noses. One of the biggest, and yet most ignored, examples of cultural appropriation in the United States is within fashion. From the runway to the hallway, people all throughout America are buying and selling items that include “native” patterns and “tribal” styles. Most big brand companies are completely unaware of this offense, and continue to make money off the objectification of Native American cultures. One of the most recent and publicized instances of this is the court case between the Urban Outfitters corporation and the Navajo Nation. </p>

		  <h3>Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>“The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-644) is a truth-in-advertising law that prohibits misrepresentation in marketing of Indian arts and crafts products within the United States. It is illegal to offer or display for sale, or sell any art or craft product in a manner that falsely suggests it is Indian produced, an Indian product, or the product of a particular Indian or Indian Tribe or Indian arts and crafts organization, resident within the United States. For a first time violation of the Act, an individual can face civil or criminal penalties up to a $250,000 fine or a 5-year prison term, or both. If a business violates the Act, it can face civil penalties or can be prosecuted and fined up to $1,000,000.” (The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990) </p>
