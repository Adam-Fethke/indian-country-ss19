      <h1>Round Valley Reservation, Education, and the Sherman Institute</h1>
      <h3>1920s- Current Day </h3>
	  <h4>TRAVERSE COTTRELL</h4>
         <h2>Early 1900s Sherman Indian Institute</h2>
         <p>During the early 1900s, boarding schools were implemented across the United States
          in an attempt to educate the native population of western ideologies. Because public
          schools were ill-advised for natives, due to the extreme Californian racism among the
          white parents, agents nd superintendents "recognized that Sherman was one of the few places 
          Round Valley Indian children could continue their education." (Bauer 404)</p>
          <p>In 1903, the Sherman Institute was created, off reservation, with four dormitories available to live in, 
          offering Western education for grades 9-12. During the students' stay, they would be segregated
          by gender, taught different curriculum, and were given negative reinforcement towards white superiority
          (The Students of Sherman Indian School 50). The curriculum that the students were given 
          was unlike any teaching that they have encountered before, as gendered tasks were not as 
          clear as a mark of native society. "Reservation agents and school superintendents believed 
          that a proper Victorian home life, with sexual purity before marriage, monogamous and life-long
          marriages, and separate economic gender spheres, was central to the goal of assimilating Round
          Valley Indians.</p>
          <p>In regards to the particular curriculum their students learned, females were assigned 
          duties such as creaming vegetables, practicing good table service, and personal habits in the
          kitchen and dining room (Bauer 409). These activities were described as "the cult of true womanhood,"
          with the ideal woman showing "purity, piety, selflessness, domesticity, obedience, and meekness."
          Males were taught the types and breeds of dairy cattle, shown how to care for the cows and
          their milk, and explained how to increase the size of ones herd. They would be put under 
          long hours of strenuous labor to educate them on farming, stock raising, plant production, and 
          for beautifying home grounds. (Bauer 410)</p>
       <h2>Mid 30s to Early 50s</h2>
       	<p>As the government made moves towards self-determination, similarly did the students of 
       	Sherman Institute. In 1938, the students formed a student council, and it soon developed into an 
       	Intertribal Reform (Bahr 44). The push towards self-determination started to shift the 
       	environment towards a more hospitable school, but as this progressed, World War II began.
       	For a long period beginning in 1948, Sherman shifted its mode of operation, of where they 
       	no longer enrolled students, was effectively shut down, and began teaching and building aircrafts
       	to assist in the war (Bahr 48).</p>
       	<p>From the point of where Sherman Institute became militarized in its education, it adopted 
       	much of the militaristic jargon, of where the Navajo program began to educate Indians 
       	for 6 months of negative reinforcement of white superiority (Bahr 50). If students did not wish to participate
       	in this program after joining, they would be considered a 'deserter,' which shows "evidence of
       	the persistence of the military structure, despite the goal of the [IRA] to eliminate the 
       	military regimentation (Bahr 54).</p>
       	<h2>Mid 50s to Early 70s</h2>
       	<p> The shift from militarization and assimilation to self-determination began to shape
       	the Sherman Institute again. Senator Robert Kennedy released a statement regarding Native education,
       	saying that "The Indians were promised an adequate education, but those treaties have been 
       	broken...We pledge ourselves to make efforts for improvement at this Institute and in Indian
       	schools across the country" (Bahr 79). This then triggered a comprehensive investigation of 
       	education among Natives across the nation.</p>
       	<p> Elwin Svenson, a reporter for the government regarding Native education, found a total of
       	10 inadequacies with the Sherman Institute, including inadequate staff, funding, admissions
       	criteria, student interest, and administrative skill in budgeting (Bahr 81). Promptly after this,
       	at the North Fork conference, the ad hoc committee stressed the need for Indian involvement
       	in their own education process, and the value of Native heritage (Bahr 84). In fact, they
       	eventually evolved into the California Indian Education Association (CIEA), of where they expressed
       	their concerns to Sherman, "with these specific recommendations: an all-Indian board of
       	directors, a program that reflected California Indian enrollment, curricula that expressed 
       	Indian concepts, a lower student-teacher ratio, and accommodations for visiting parents (Bahr 84).
       	On January 7th, 1967, for the first time since 1948, California Indians would be enrolled at the Sherman Institute, 
       	under new management. A new age of education dawned for many Californian Indians.</p>
       	<h2>Mid 70s to the 21st Century</h2>
       	<p>In 1972, the Endian Education Act passed, which allowed Indians to determine their 
       	own curriculum (Bahr 91). There was an amazing positive reform for Native education, such as 
       	driver education classes, and physical education Ibid. This new policy was completely 
       	evident in the Sherman arts and crafts program. The Institute brought in tribal craftsmen 
       	from major tribes, to teach their own specialties (Bahr 92). Students were so engaged with 
       	this program that they no longer wanted to leave the classroom. A decade later, the Native American
       	Languages Act of 1990 passed, which moved to preserve Native languages, and to help promote
       	the education of them again to prevent the loss of their language (Bahr 99). In addition, this 
       	allowed Native American languages to be the main language they use in schools, which allowed
       	education to move towards a more traditional and preservation stance Ibid.  </p>
