         <h3>About the Seminole Tribe</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, 
		 <p>The Florida Seminole tribe is the only federally-recognized tribe in America who hasn't signed a peace treaty. Their lands lie primarily in southern Florida. This tribal nation was a nation that made it's living on many different ways that include gaming, though, that isn't the only way in which they do. Recently, a man by the name of James Billie was elected Tribal Council Chairman. It was under his leadership that the tribe has matured in many different ways. The goal of the Seminole tribe has always been for self-reliance and they've been taking many steps in that direction.</p>
		 <p>The existence of several different gaming facilities are just the beginning of their profit. They also opened up a hotel called the Sheraton Tampa East which is solely based near Tampa, Florida. The economy around them has been increasingly strengthening due to the businesses that are being added to it, as well as contribution to education.</p>
